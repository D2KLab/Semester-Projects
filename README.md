# Semester Projects - Guidelines

Instructions and examples for Semester Projects at EURECOM.


## Report

* **Share** your report and slides since they are in progress, so that we can comment on them.
  * This will give you the possibility to improve them BEFORE the defense, to have a better grade.
  * Use shared drives! Attaching documents to emails is a bad practice for storage and environmental reasons.
* **Cite properly** figures and text coming from other works in both slides and report.
  * In the report, it would be better to have a proper reference section at the end, and refers to papers using numbers (e.g. `[1]`) or authors' names and year (e.g. `(Grover et al, 2016)`).
  * The references should precisely mention authors' names, title, publication venue, year. Example:
  
  ```text
  A. Grover and J. Leskovec. node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks.
  In: ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2016.
  ```

  * If you are using LaTex, the best option is to use a bibfile, including the bib record directly downloaded from the journal website (e.g. look at the _Export citation_ option on [any ACM paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939754))
* **Use your own words** as much as you can.
  * Including some sentences coming from other works is allowed (with moderation) if properly referenced
  * Copying a sentence and putting synonyms here and there... it is still copying.
  * Copying is bad! Referencing is good!
* Your report should include **all relevant links** to your project results: Google Drive folders, Git repositories, Colab notebooks, etc.
* Make clear what **your contribution** is.
  * If you replicate a paper, make clear what are _your_ ideas and what are _original authors'_ ones.
* **How long should a report be?** As long as it needs! 😄 Don't focus on the page length, but take as much space you need to well describe your work. It is a bad practice to add unnecessary sentences just for making your report longer.
* Add a **"Use of AI Tools"** section (see the AI policy below)

## Presentation

* The presentation should last **30 minutes** and is followed by a round of questions.
* Be **didactical**. The audience may not be familiar with your project and with the topic you studied. Be sure to define precisely all specific terms.
* Add **slides number**. They will help who is listening to you to make precise questions during the defense.
* **Cite properly** figures and text coming from other works in both slides and report.
  * On slides, it is ok to have a shorter reference, e.g. `A. Grover et al. node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks. KDD, 2016`
* **Rehearse** your presentation before, for checking the time and the expressions that you use. Change the presentation to serve your speech.
* **Avoid going on and back** on the slides, instead structure them in order to have a linear storyline.
* **Don't overfill the slides**. In each slide it should be clear: where do I need to put my attention? Sometimes less content help the focus of the listeners. A clear exception are result slides, where we need to have tables with different scores to be able to compare the results.

## Policy on the Use of AI Tools

✅ Permitted use: AI tools may be used for project work, reports, and materials.
BUT the use must be transparent, responsible, and documented.

* **Disclosure**. Clearly state when, where, and how AI tools were used/
Applies to: text drafting, coding, figure generation, literature summarization, language refinement
* **Documentation.**
Include a section titled “Use of AI Tools” in your report:
  * Which AI system was used
  * For what purpose
  * How the output was verified
* **Accountability.**
Students are fully responsible for accuracy, originality, and integrity.
AI output must be reviewed, adapted, and critically evaluated.
* **Ethics & Integrity**
No fabricated data, falsified results, or misrepresented sources.
**Undisclosed use = breach of academic integrity**.

**AI can assist you, but you must stay in control, transparent, and accountable.**


## Past year examples

Some good examples are included in the [`examples` folder](https://github.com/D2KLab/Semester-Projects/tree/main/examples).
Use them for taking inspiration, but then find the best way to produce report and slides specifically for your project.
