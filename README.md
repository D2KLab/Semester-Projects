# Semester Projects
Instructions and examples for Semester Projects at EURECOM

## Report

* **Share** your report and slides since they are in progress, so that we can comment on them.
  * This will give you the possibility to improve them BEFORE the defense, to have a better grade.
  * Use shared drives! Attaching documents to emails is a bad practice for storage and environmental reasons.
* **Cite properly** figures and text coming from other works in both slides and report.
  * In the report, it would be better to have a proper reference section at the end, and refers to papers using numbers (e.g. `[1]`) or authors' names and year (e.g. `(Grover et al, 2016)`).
  * The references should precisely mention authors' names, title, publication venue, year. Example:
  ```
  A. Grover and J. Leskovec. node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks.  In: ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2016.
  ```
  * If you are using LaTex, the best option is to use a bibfile, including the bib record directly downloaded from the journal website (e.g. look at  the _Export citation_ option on [any ACM paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939754))
* **Use your own words** as much as you can.
  * Including some sentences coming from other works is allowed (with moderation) if properly referenced
  * Copying a sentence and putting synonyms here and there... it is still copying.
  * Copying is bad! Referencing is good!
* Your report should include **all relevant links** to your project results: Google Drive folders, Git repositories, Colab notebooks, etc.
* Make clear what **your contribution** is.
  * If you replicate a paper, make clear what are *your* ideas and what are *original authors'* ones.

## Presentation

* The presentation should last **30 minutes** and is followed by a round of questions.
* Be **didactical**. The audience may not be familiar with your project and with the topic you studied. Be sure to define precisely all specific terms.
* Add **slides number**. They will help who is listening to you to make precise questions during the defense.
* **Cite properly** figures and text coming from other works in both slides and report.
  * On slides, it is ok to have a shorter reference, e.g. `A. Grover et al. node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks. KDD, 2016`
* **Rehearse** your presentation before, for checking the time and the expressions that you use. Change the presentation to serve your speech.
* **Avoid to go on and back** on the slides, instead structure them in order to have a linear storyline.
